- 👋 Hi, I’m @moldmann
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that helps making SW Development more efficient like e.g. Git, Agile, Pairing, TDD, CI/CD 
- 🌱 I’m currently fascinated by the Enneagram personality test and how it can improve team interactions and how the Theory of Constraints can sharpen our thinking
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my collection of versatile Git scripts, like i.e. a Worktree based full checkout diff tool (https://github.com/moldmann/git-scripts)
